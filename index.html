        <p>Egypt was confronted with significant obstacles that threaten its stability. climate change is one of these obstacles. 
            Detecting the climate change was the first step in resolving this issue; as a response, the climate change was detected using s
            ensors  and the gathered data was transferred to a website for visualisation. Changes in rainfall quantity affect the soil's pH. 
            Due to the chemical reaction between the rain and the soil, the soil's subsequent weathering, an abundance of precipitation lowers
             the pH of soil. To ensure that the prototype is functional, two design requirements were established; the aim of the project was
             attended  by meeting these design requirements. These requirements were the dynamic range and graphical user interface.
              Our prototype's construction consisted of two sections: rainfall simulation and code . Two tests were conducted . 
              During the first test,  the prototype was prevented from achieving our goal by some issues . 
              Some m odifications were made to solve these issues. The second test was successful, our objective was 
              accomplished by meeting the design requirements. Working on the project led us to the conclusion that the pH decreases 
              proportionally with rainfall. 
            In addition, the instrument that detects climatic change required a large dynamic range.
